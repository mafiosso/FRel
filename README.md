Fuzzy relation solver (FRel)
============================

- C99 language, bindings to Lisp
- API for handling theory of Fuzzy logic, Fuzzy set and Fuzzy relational equations
- different data storage Matrix, QuadTree, AdaptiveQuadTree, Hashes, ...
- different L-systems
- support for non-linear residual lattices
- solver of fuzzy relational equations (maximal solution, minimal solution, all minimal solutions, semi lattice of all solutions)
- automatic transformation of fuzzy relations to fuzzy rules for practical use (fuzzy automata, engineering tasks)
